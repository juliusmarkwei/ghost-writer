# GhostWriter

A cross-platform CLI tool that simulates a developer typing code in real-time. It reads source files from your project and "types" them into Vim (terminal-based editor), mimicking human typing speeds and natural coding habits—perfect for demonstrations, tutorials, or just having fun watching code write itself.

## ✨ Features

-   **Human-like Typing**: Variable typing speeds (100-300ms delays) to mimic realistic behavior
-   **Realistic Pauses**: Occasional "thinking" pauses (5-15 seconds) to simulate developer workflow
-   **Smart Focus Management**: Automatically detects and maintains focus on safe editor applications
-   **Mouse Movement Detection**: Instantly stops when you move your mouse, giving you immediate control
-   **Directory & File Support**: Process entire directories or individual files
-   **Automated Workflow**: Creates temporary subprojects, opens files in Vim, and starts typing automatically
-   **Looping Mode**: Runs continuously for a specified duration (default 30 minutes), recreating sessions after each cycle
-   **Language Agnostic**: Dynamically detects file extensions and creates matching simulation files
-   **Built-in Test Source**: Includes comprehensive TypeScript test content when no source is specified
-   **Robust Cleanup**: Ensures fresh files for every cycle with proper signal handling
-   **Cross-Platform Support**:
    -   **macOS**: Uses `osascript` (built-in)
    -   **Linux**: Uses `xdotool` (auto-installed)
    -   **Windows**: Uses PowerShell (built-in)

    ```

3. **Or run directly without installing:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x index.sh
    ./index.sh
    ```

### Verifying Installation

After installation, verify it works:

```bash
ghost-writer --help
```

If you see the help message, you're all set! 🎉

## 📖 Usage

### Basic Usage

Simply run `ghost-writer` in any project directory:

```bash
ghost-writer
```

This will:

1. Search for default source files (`src/app/main/index.ts`, `src/index.ts`, or `index.ts`)
2. If none found, use the built-in test source (comprehensive TypeScript example)
3. Run for 30 minutes with realistic typing speeds
4. Create a `simulation-subproject` folder for output files

### CLI Options

| Option                 | Alias | Default                 | Description                                      |
| :--------------------- | :---- | :---------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `--duration <minutes>` | `-d`  | `30`                    | How long to run the simulation (in minutes)      |
| `--min-delay <ms>`     |       | `100`                   | Minimum delay between keystrokes (faster typing) |
| `--max-delay <ms>`     |       | `300`                   | Maximum delay between keystrokes (slower typing) |
| `--name <name>`        |       | `simulation-subproject` | Name of the temporary subproject folder          |
| `--source <path>`      |       | (auto-detect)           | Path to source file or directory to type         |
| `--help`               | `-h`  |                         | Display help message and exit                    |

### Examples

#### Run with default settings

```bash
ghost-writer
```

#### Run for 1 hour

```bash
ghost-writer --duration 60
```

#### Type faster (50-150ms delays)

```bash
ghost-writer --min-delay 50 --max-delay 150
```

#### Type slower (200-500ms delays)

```bash
ghost-writer --min-delay 200 --max-delay 500
```

#### Use a specific file

```bash
ghost-writer --source src/utils.ts
```

#### Process an entire directory

```bash
ghost-writer --source src/ --duration 90
```

#### Custom subproject name

```bash
ghost-writer --name my-demo-project
```

#### Combined options

```bash
ghost-writer --source src/components/ --duration 120 --min-delay 80 --max-delay 200 --name demo
```

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Project Detection**: Automatically finds your project root by looking for `package.json`
2. **Source Resolution**:
    - If `--source` specified: Uses that exact file or directory
    - If no `--source`: Searches for default files in order: `src/app/main/index.ts` → `src/index.ts` → `index.ts`
    - If none found: Uses built-in comprehensive test source
3. **File Processing**:
    - **Single file**: Types just that file
    - **Directory**: Processes all files recursively (excluding hidden files and `node_modules`)
4. **Typing Simulation**:
    - Opens each file in Vim (in a new Terminal window)
    - Enters Insert mode and types line-by-line with random delays
    - Preserves original indentation
    - Types line-by-line with random delays between keystrokes
    - Occasional "thinking" pauses (every ~20 lines)
    - Monitors mouse position and stops if movement detected
5. **Looping**: After completing all files, waits briefly and restarts until duration expires

## 🛡️ Safety Features

### Mouse Movement Detection

**Instant termination** when you move your mouse:

-   Continuously monitors cursor position
-   Detects any movement from the initial position
-   Terminates the simulation immediately
-   Gives you instant control back

### Focus Management

**Prevents typing in wrong applications**:

-   Only types into safe applications (Terminal, Vim, iTerm, etc.)
-   Automatically refocuses your editor if focus is lost
-   Pauses if an unsafe application is active
-   Whitelist includes: Terminal, iTerm, Warp, Alacritty, Hyper, kitty, vim, nvim, and other terminal emulators

### Graceful Cleanup

-   Handles `Ctrl+C` (SIGINT) cleanly
-   Stops mouse monitor process
-   Cleans up temporary files
-   No zombie processes left behind

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### macOS: `osascript is not allowed to send keystrokes`

**Solution:**

1. Go to **System Settings** (or System Preferences on older macOS)
2. Navigate to **Privacy & Security** → **Accessibility**
3. Find your **Terminal** application (Terminal.app, iTerm, etc.)
4. **Check the box** to allow it to control your computer
5. Restart your terminal and try again

### Linux: `xdotool: command not found`

**Solution:**
The install script should handle this automatically, but if needed:

```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y xdotool

# Fedora
sudo dnf install -y xdotool

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S xdotool

# openSUSE
sudo zypper install xdotool
```

### Vim: `vim: command not found`

**Solution:**

**macOS:**

```bash
brew install vim
```

**Linux:**

```bash
sudo apt-get install vim  # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo dnf install vim      # Fedora
sudo pacman -S vim        # Arch
```

### Windows: Script won't run

**Solutions:**

1. **Use Git Bash** or **WSL** (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
2. Ensure PowerShell is available:
    ```bash
    powershell.exe -Command "Write-Host 'PowerShell works'"
    ```
3. Run from Git Bash, not Command Prompt

### Mouse detection not working

**Possible causes:**

-   **macOS**: Python 3 not installed (install via Homebrew: `brew install python3`)
-   **Linux**: xdotool not installed or not in PATH
-   **Windows**: PowerShell scripting disabled (run: `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`)

### Typing is too slow/fast

**Solution:**
Adjust the delay parameters:

```bash
# Faster typing (50-100ms delays)
ghost-writer --min-delay 50 --max-delay 100

# Slower typing (300-600ms delays)
ghost-writer --min-delay 300 --max-delay 600
```

### Script stops immediately

**Possible causes:**

1. **Mouse moved**: Even slight touchpad touches trigger termination (this is intentional!)
2. **Source file not found**: Check the error message and verify the path
3. **Vim not installed**: The script needs Vim to be installed

### Permission errors during installation

**Solution:**

If `/usr/local/bin` is not writable:

```bash
# Install to user directory instead
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juliusmarkwei/ghost-writer/main/index.sh -o ~/.local/bin/ghost-writer
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/ghost-writer

# Add to PATH (add this to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc)
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin"
```
